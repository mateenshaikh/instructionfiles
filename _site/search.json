You can actually do most forms with this, but it just makes it more work because you spend more time looking appropriate codes and you have to enter the taxes.\nIn Cheque Req, you’ll see the ccodes for Fund, Origin (org/org), Account. Fill those in. We don’t use Program, Activity, or Location. Leave activity and location blank, but put in 99999 for Program. If you have different Fund, or different Accounts (for different money uses) then use different lines. If you need more than the 3 provided you can attach a second form. If you only need one combination of fund/org/acct you can split it up, but it’s cleaner to put it in one line and split it up on another document.\nIf your receipts identify GST and PST costs, separate them out and list the subtototal, taxes, and total. If you only have the total, just put in the final total.\n\n2.2.1 Receipts:\nIf you just have one receipt and one reimbursement, you can just append it as a second page of the pdf. Clearly highlight the total you used that appears on the form to make it easier for finance.\nIf you have multiple receipts, you really should make a tiny janky spreadsheet to keep track of everything and make sure you’ve accounted for it all. In the spreadsheet put what’s being claimed, the amount, and which receipt it is. For the last, I put the corresponding page number on the pdf so it’s easy to cross reference. Keep a total at the bottom and let the spreadsheet math do the work. I actually attach the spreadsheet right after the form (which adds another page to the big pdf) but then the finance folks know what info I was using. While I’m working I usually put a blank page in the big pdf file until the spreadsheet is complete. That way, the page counts stay accurate."
